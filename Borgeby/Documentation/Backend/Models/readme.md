# Naming of content types
All naming information for content types, like blocks, pages, tabs, etc... is to be included in lang files. The purpose of this approach is to make the edit mode in EPiServer highly language adapted.

**Tabs**
Tab translations are located in lang/GroupNames_XX.xml

**Properties and page/block types**
Translations are located in lang/PropertyNames_XX.xml
